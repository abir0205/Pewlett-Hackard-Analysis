# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project was to determine:
 - which employees are retiring based on their age and how long they had worked
 - the unique job titles for the positions listed
 - which employees would be eligible to be mentors
 - the titles of those who are retiring

 This information was determined with the various csv files provided and new tables and csv files were made to parse through this data more efficiently.

 This project was designed to be an easy way for the students to grasp the basic functionalities of SQL.

## Results

- 41,381 employees were retiring
- There are 8 different titles for each group of retirees
- 1,550 employees are eligible to be mentors

## Summary

Given that such a large portion of the current work force will be retiring, there may not be enough qualified workers for the silver tsunami. There are likely isn't a large enough amount of mentors to train the next generation.
